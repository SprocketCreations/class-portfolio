## Description

This is a portfolio of all the noteworthy projects I completed during the bootcamp. As I complete projects, I will add them to this visualizer.

## Usage

You can view the site [here.](https://sprocketcreations.github.io/class-portfolio/) It has only one page, but it is responsive, and links to my much cooler personal website that has a more interesting portfolio.
